## Tutor Today
- mobile application for matching parents with tutors
- equipped with customisation features
- an intuitive and comprehensive design
- providing communication facilitating information

## Development
- Platform: Andriod Studio
- Language: Java


## Restrictions
1) Limit of requests / messages \
The upper limit of requests / messages for each page is currently 4, as after endless debugging and emails, Recyclerview cannot be implemented. However, requests are still shown dynamically, and the upper limit is merely due to time constraints. 

2) SQLite as database for requests and requests \
As personal web servers are not provided by the CS department, our group has chosen to utilize SQLite in the context of this project, which allows testing on different devices without any setup (not possible with the method of local host). 

3) Testing devices \
We do acknowledge that for certain smartphones, the layout may exceed the size of the screen. We highly advise using Pixel 2 API 31, as our app is developed and tested with it. We have also implemented ScrollView for screens that cannot contain all information.

** We believe with further development or with a larger group size, the above restrictions can certainly be removed, as with the limited time frame, our group of two has implemented two sections (parent / tutor) of Tutor Today with a myriad of features  with nearly no compromises. **


## Testing on Andriod Studio
*** If your device has run our application before, please click WIPE DATA and COLD BOOT in AVD manager. This is a MUST to experience our app. *** 

Please create parent / tutor accounts to test the functionalities of our application, as it comes with no test accounts. We have implemented user input checking for all required fields so that the input process can be frictionless and intuitive for all users.
